Files
==============

You can view and download both GeoPackages and Images via the Files menu

Usage
------------

The Files section maintains files for the Retention period specified in the Daemon section.
  
   .. image:: images/Synchronize-Files.png

   .. note::  Files are distinct from PostGIS data.  Deleting files will not delete anything in your database, only the raw file saved to GeoSync disk
