Short Version
------------

1.  On the Server page, add your Mergin Maps server.

2.  On the Project page, add your project.  You can have a PostGIS database created for you automatically or you can connect to an existing PostGIS database.

3.  On the Service page, start the service.

That's it!

There are many more configuration options and features, but the above three steps are all that is required.
