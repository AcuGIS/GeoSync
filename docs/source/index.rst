GeoSync 
===================================

GeoSync syncronizes data from QFieldCloud, Mergin Maps, and Survey123 to PostGIS.

It works with all versions of QFiedlCloud (hosted or self-hosted), Mergin Maps (Team Account or self-hosted), and ArGIS Survey123

Data can be synchronized to existing PostGIS databases or you can create new PostGIS databases.
